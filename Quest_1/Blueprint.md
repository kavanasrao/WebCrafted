**Quest_1 :** *Foundation of HTML~The Blueprint of the Web*


# What is HTML?

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It structures content on the web by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other media. HTML documents are used by browsers to render the content that users interact with on the web.

# Why is HTML Needed?

HTML is essential for the following reasons:

1. **Structure**: It provides the basic structure for web pages. Without HTML, websites would lack any organized layout and would be difficult to navigate or interact with.
2. **Accessibility**: HTML ensures that all types of web content (text, images, videos, etc.) are organized and accessible, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
3. **Web Compatibility**: It is the fundamental technology used by web browsers to render content. Without HTML, browsers would not be able to display webpages.
4. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: HTML plays a crucial role in SEO. Proper HTML structure helps search engines understand the content of your page, which improves its visibility.

# How Does HTML Work?
When a user enters a URL or searches something in the browser, the following steps occur:

1. **Request to the Server**: The browser sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to the server hosting the webpage.
2. **Server Response**: The server responds with the content of the webpage in HTML format.
3. **Rendering the Content**: The browser takes the HTML content and uses it to build and render the webpage, displaying it for the user to interact with.

HTML works by using **tags** to define elements within the document. These tags describe the structure and content of the webpage. 

For example:
<html>,<head>,<body>

**The Skeleton of a Webpage**

<!Doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
    which is not displayed on the web page
    </head>
    <body>
    which is displayed on the web page
    </body>
</html>

<html>: The root of all things web-related.
<head>: Houses metadata, links, and other unseen elements.
<body>: The home of all visible content.
