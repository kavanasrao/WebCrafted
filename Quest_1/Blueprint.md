# What is HTML?

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It structures content on the web by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other media. HTML documents are used by browsers to render the content that users interact with on the web.

# Why is HTML Needed?

HTML is essential for the following reasons:

1. **Structure**: It provides the basic structure for web pages. Without HTML, websites would lack any organized layout and would be difficult to navigate or interact with.
2. **Accessibility**: HTML ensures that all types of web content (text, images, videos, etc.) are organized and accessible, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
3. **Web Compatibility**: It is the fundamental technology used by web browsers to render content. Without HTML, browsers would not be able to display webpages.

HTML works by using **tags** to define elements within the document. These tags describe the structure and content of the webpage. For example:
